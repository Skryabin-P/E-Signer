# E-signer GUI 

This program was written for organisation I work. 
It posts digital signs in .pfx on pdf files automatically.
You just need provide folders where you have .pfx certificates, .pdf files and where you want to store your signed files.

### It has 2 modes:
- Sign only last page
- Sign all pages

Sign will be placed in the bottom of a page. Up to 3 signs work correctly

This program helps our employee focus on their job, not bureaucracy

Our employees have the same certificate password, so I just hardcoded it. You can change it in GUI.py on 91 string
or you can add another field in interface and grab password from it

### Also
 It can easyly  be transformed to .exe with pyinstaller lib
